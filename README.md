+ `Infinite Grid:` No grid size limitation.
+ `Conway's Game of Life:` CAEngine is specifically designed to run Conway's Game of Life.
+ `3D Simulation:` Unlike traditional implementations which are 2D, CAEngine operates in a three-dimensional space.
## Rules
+ A live cell that has live neighbors below 5 or above 6 dies.
+ A dead cell that has 4 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
