### Features
+ Infinite Grid: No grid size limitation.
+ Conway's Game of Life: CAEngine is specifically designed to run Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton with simple rules but complex emergent behavior.
+ 3D Simulation: Unlike traditional implementations which are 2D, CAEngine operates in a three-dimensional space, allowing for more intricate patterns and interactions.
+ Flexible Architecture: The engine is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and customize for different cellular automaton rules and behaviors.
+ Visualization: CAEngine includes built-in visualization tools to observe the evolution of the cellular automaton in real-time, providing insights into the emergent patterns and dynamics.
+ Configurability: Users can adjust various parameters such as the size of the grid, initial configurations, and simulation speed to tailor the behavior of the cellular automaton to their specific needs.
+ Cross-Platform: CAEngine is designed to be cross-platform, ensuring compatibility with various operating systems.
